    <p>
      The eternal emperor, Valkorion, is the leader and founder of the eternal
      empire, and sith empire spanning over 1700 years. Sustained for centuries
      by his force abilities he quickly overthrew all opposing enemy's at a
      young age then created and ruled over two separate empires for centuries
      before finally being killed through his own sons betrayal. Before his time
      as the <i>Immortal Emperor</i> he was known as the sith lord
      <i>Vitiate</i>. He lived for 1300 years as the sith emperor, inhabiting a
      body his spirit had possessed. Even before his time as a sith lord he was
      known as <i>Tenebrae</i>, A sith pure-blood. His father was a powerful
      sith lord who ruled over their plant, and illegitimately fathered Tenebrea
      to a poor woman on the outskirts of their home. Tenebrea's father returned
      to confront him after he had begun to carve a path of death and
      destruction at the age of ten. Even at his young age Tenebrea overpowered
      and severed his father connection to the force and imprisoned his spirit
      for a millennia, conquering his home world and starting his reign over the
      galaxy.

    <h3>The Eternal Empire & The Eternal Fleet</h3>
    <p>
      <b><i>Valkorion</i></b
      >, through his millennia of life had experience that outmatched all others
      in the franchise. Even some of the most brilliant minds including the
      likes of Revan, Luke Skywalker, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and even Emperor
      Palpatine, who was responsible for the downfall of the entire jedi order
      and republic, did not have the prowess that Valkorion held. As the
      commander of the Eternal Fleet Valkorion became a threat to both the
      republic, and the sith empire. Unbeknownst to either side was that he had
      been orchestrating the entire galaxy for the past millennia. Aside from
      being the greatest mind in the series, he was one, if not the most
      powerful force wielder in the franchise. strong enough to make voids in
      the force, areas that have no presence of the force and subsequently leave
      both Jedi and Sith powerless.

    <h3>
      Abilities & Aliases<img src="the three.png" class="align-center medium" />
    </h3>
    <p>
      As powerful as he was, Valkorion did fear one thing, death. His fear of
      death controlled him and in response to that his only goal was to become
      immortal, even at the expense of the entire galaxy. One of his methods was
      to drain the life force of other beings which he could do to entire
      planets, in order to prolong his life. He also could move his spirit into
      other body's. his original form was a tall pure blood with red skin under
      his birth name of Tenebrea, to rule the sith empire he adopted the body of
      a short stature human male with pale gray skin and yellow eyes under the
      name of Darth Vitiate. Once he abandoned the sith empire to form the
      Eternal Empire, he possessed the body of a high class noble under the name
      Valkorion and formed his new empire not in line with either the sith, nor
      jedi.
